# Hyperspectral-imaging-project

This project is merely a discovery of some features extraction methods and their resulting classification when coupled with a random forest classifier, via the use of Behnood Rasti's toolbox: https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/HyFTech-Hyperspectral-Shallow-Deep-Feature-Extraction-Toolbox

If you intend to use my code, please download Behnood Rasti's toolbox first and then put it in the root 
"HyFTech-Hyperspectral-Shallow-Deep-Feature-Extraction-Toolbox". You will also need HSI data, in my case, I used the 2013 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset available here: https://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/?page_id=459. You'll need to extract yourself the .tif data to a .mat and rename it "HU2013" though.
